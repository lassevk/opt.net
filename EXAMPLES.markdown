The examples that are shipped as part of the Opt.Net
[repository][1] requires [LINQPad][2] to run, a free tool made
by the author of [C# 40 in a Nutshell][3], a [O'Reilly][4]
book about C# 4.0, LINQ and various other topics.

Some of the examples are fully fledged Visual Studio solutions.

Note that you need [LINQPad][2] version 4.27.1 or higher, which
at the moment means you must download the [beta version][5], as
the scripts here rely on new features related to dumping out
raw html to the output window.

Ensure that you load up the solution file in Visual Studio 2010,
and do a full rebuild for the Debug target before testing any
of the examples. They rely on the binary produced as part of the
build output.
