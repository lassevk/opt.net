The examples that are shipped as part of the Opt.Net
[repository][1] requires [LINQPad][2] to run, a free tool made
by the author of [C# 40 in a Nutshell][3], a [O'Reilly][4]
book about C# 4.0, LINQ and various other topics.

Some of the examples are fully fledged Visual Studio solutions.

Note that you need [LINQPad][2] version 4.27.1 or higher, as
the scripts here rely on features related to dumping out
raw html to the output window.

Ensure that you load up the solution file in Visual Studio 2017,
and do a full rebuild for the Debug target before testing any
of the examples. They rely on the binary produced as part of the
build output.
